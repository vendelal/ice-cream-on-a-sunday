              Why did I make a blog about ice cream?

            <AboutText>
              In the late fall of 2016 I asked for an ice cream maker for Christmas. I'm still not entirely sure why, but I do know that ice cream is delicious.
                <br /><br />
                Being someone who is more "art" than "science" (a fancy way of saying I don't like measuring things, keeping track of what I've added, or generally remembering details) eventually I started forgetting the flavors I had already made. Luckily my day job of being a web designer and front-end developer gave me the skills to make something to remember the flavors and keep track of the recipes (since they come from all different sources and inspirations).
                <br /><br />
                I'm pretty lucky to work at a <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">company</a> which gives me <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/time">investment time</a> so I started nerding out about which technologies to use to power this blog. The version you're seeing now is version 2, and I already hate it and want to build version 3 ðŸ¤“. This blog has been a pretty sweet learning tool, and I can't wait to do more fancy things with it. If you're curious about the technology behind this blog, check out the <a href="https://github.com/vendelal/ice-cream-on-a-sunday">github repo</a>.
                <br /><br />
                I hope you enjoy the recipes and tell all your friends about it so it gets famous enough for me to receive free ice cream in the mail or something!
                <br /><br />
                <em>All illustrations and photos are done by me. All the recipes are written by me, even if they were inspired by ones I found somewhere else!</em>
